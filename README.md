## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn and make predictions or decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for each specific task. Instead of writing detailed code, we provide data so computers can discover patterns and rules on their own.

## Why is Machine Learning Important?

Machine Learning is transforming how we live and work:
- **In daily life**: Netflix movie recommendations, face recognition, automatic translation
- **In business**: Customer analysis, market trend prediction, process automation
- **In healthcare**: Disease diagnosis, drug development, medical image analysis
- **In technology**: Self-driving cars, virtual assistants, intelligent search

## Main Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
- **Characteristics**: Has input data and desired output
- **Examples**: Predicting house prices based on area and location; classifying spam emails
- **Popular algorithms**: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
- **Characteristics**: Only has input data, no desired output
- **Examples**: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection in data
- **Popular algorithms**: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
- **Characteristics**: Learning through interaction and feedback from environment
- **Examples**: Game AI, autonomous robots, trading systems
- **Popular algorithms**: Q-Learning, Deep Q-Network

## Basic Machine Learning Process

### Step 1: Define the Problem
- Clearly define the objective to be achieved
- Identify the type of problem (classification, prediction, clustering...)

### Step 2: Collect and Prepare Data
- Gather data from various sources
- Clean data (handle missing values, remove noise)
- Explore and analyze initial data

### Step 3: Select and Build Model
- Choose appropriate algorithm
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Train model with training data

### Step 4: Evaluate Model
- Test performance on testing set
- Use appropriate evaluation metrics
- Adjust and optimize model

### Step 5: Deploy and Monitor
- Put model into real-world use
- Continuously monitor performance
- Update model when necessary

## Important Concepts

### Features
Attributes or variables used to describe data. Example: in house price prediction, features could be area, number of rooms, location.

### Training Data
Dataset used to "teach" the model to learn patterns and rules.

### Test Data
Separate dataset used to evaluate model performance after training.

### Overfitting and Underfitting
- **Overfitting**: Model learns training data too well, doesn't generalize well
- **Underfitting**: Model is too simple, doesn't capture patterns in data

## Tools and Programming Languages
